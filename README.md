# Reniforcement-Learning-Algorithms
Implementations of different RL algorithms
- Some of the codes for written in Google Colab hence they have additional part of code to make OpenAI Gym work.
- All the codes have been commented properly. 

Algorithms that have implemented till now
- Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and Tabular Q-Learning in the frozen lake environment from openAI Gym.
- Deep Q-Learning on Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym.
